The Norse Runes Oracle Plugin allows you to interpret single runes or do rune castings.

== Description ==

Norse Runes are an ancient alphabet used in Germanic countries. Today, they are used in magic and divination by many Pagans and Wiccans. Although their meanings can sometimes be a bit obscure, most people who work with runes find that the best way to incorporate them into divination is to ask a specific question based upon your current situation. Although you don't have to be of Norse ancestry to use the runes, you'll have a far better understanding of the symbols and their meanings if you have some knowledge of the mythology and history of the Germanic peoples; this way you can interpret the runes in the context in which they were meant to be read.

This Plugin allows you to use runes as a functioning part of your website.

Here are some of the current features:

* Show all the Runes on a given page.
* Show a specific rune with meaning on a given page.
* Show the Definition of a given Rune by a Tool Tip or a Defined Definitions Page.
* Current Spreads Available
	* Odin's Rune (One Rune Layout)
	* Past, Present and Future (Three Rune) Layout
	* Expanded Celtic Cross Spread (Twelve Rune Layout)
	* Custom Spread

Features for Future Releases:

* Ability for people to create accounts and track readings over time.
* Ability to do different castings with Meanings and Interpretations. Some examples:
	* Two Rune Layout
	* Four Directions Layout
	* Five Rune Cross Layout
	* Midgard Serpent Layout
	* Bifr√∂st Layout
	* Grid of Nine Layout
	* Odin's Nine Layout
	* Egil's Whalebone Layout
* Adding ability for someone to show any number of runes on a page so they could do their own rune spreads even if they are not known to the system.
